        <p>
            Description: This project aims to demonstrate the deployment process of a Todo web application using modern
            DevOps tools and practices. Leveraging GitHub for version control, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes
            for orchestration, and Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), the deployment
            pipeline ensures efficient development, testing, and deployment workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
            1. **GitHub**: The project utilizes GitHub for version control, enabling collaborative development and
            version tracking. Developers can work on features and bug fixes in branches, ensuring a structured and
            organized development process.
        </p>
        <p>
            2. **Docker**: Docker is employed for containerization, encapsulating the Todo web application and its
            dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. This approach ensures consistency across different
            environments and simplifies deployment across various platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            3. **Kubernetes**: Kubernetes serves as the orchestration platform for managing and scaling containerized
            applications. By deploying the Todo web app on Kubernetes, the application benefits from automated scaling,
            load balancing, and self-healing capabilities, ensuring high availability and reliability.

        </P>
        <p>
            4. **Jenkins CI/CD**: Jenkins is utilized for implementing continuous integration and continuous deployment
            pipelines. Upon every code commit to the GitHub repository, Jenkins automatically triggers the CI/CD
            pipeline. The pipeline includes stages for building Docker images, running tests, deploying containers to
            Kubernetes clusters, and monitoring the deployment process.
        </p>

        <p>
            Through the integration of these tools, the deployment of the Todo web app becomes streamlined, automated,
            and resilient. Developers can focus on writing code, while the CI/CD pipeline handles the rest, from
            building to deployment, ensuring a smooth and efficient software delivery process.
